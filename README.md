# <Password Generator>

## This webpage is meant to create a randomized password between 8 and 128 characters, consisting of lowercase and upercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters depending on the input entered into the prompt boxes.

## Installation

## Usage
    The webpage barely has any function thus far. When the button is clicked, a prompt appears asking for the first criteria with the between 8 and 128 litmit. If the number entered is not within that margin, a prompt will appear that says it must be. However, that will not stop the function from going on to the next question. All of the question prompts pop up, but the information has zero consequence when input into the text box. I have failed in this assignment, but I am going to get tutoring and figure out what I'm missing.
